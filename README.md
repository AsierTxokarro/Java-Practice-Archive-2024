# Java Practice Archive (DAM 2024–2025)

This repository contains my early Java exercises from the first year of DAM.

These projects are **archived** and kept only for reference.  
They include:

- `ejerciciosDiagramas` – Small exercises based on diagrams and basic logic.
- `Calculadora4V` – Simple calculator built in Java for class practice.
- `calculadoraPrueba` – Experimental calculator used to test ideas.
- `ListaTareas4V` – Basic task list project for DAM1.

Current focus:  
👉 I’m now working on more advanced and structured projects like the **Happy Flower Project (IoT)** and other Java/OOP applications.
